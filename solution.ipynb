    "1. First, test the best fitness (at the last generation) of the baseline implementation with the basic arithmetic operators.\n",
    "2. We will also test the fitness when we add more operators to the internal nodes set, specifically all the non-linear operators defined in the genepro/node_impl.py file. We expect the fitness to decrease, as the search space will be larger. This initial test is to see if this hypothesis holds.\n",
    "3. We will then give the algorithm more resources (twice the population size and twice the number of generations) and count which operators are present in the final trees. This will give us an idea of which operators are more useful in the context of the Lunar Lander environment.\n",
